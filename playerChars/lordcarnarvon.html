                        <p>Born on June 26th of 1866 in Highclere Castle he is part of the anglo-welsh dynasty Herbert
                            and
                            can look back on ancients back to King Edward III. and King Henry VII. As the only heir of
                            his
                            father Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, he also wears the courtesy title Lord
                            Porchester
                            and was called "Porchy" by his family<br />
                            Tought by home teachers he was already able at the age of ten to talk French to his mother
                            and his educators. Besides he knew German, Latin grammar and basics of the Greek language.
                            He visited the universities of Eton and Cambridge. There he started to collect french
                            prints and drawings.<br />
                            During holidays at the family mansion Altachiara - Italian for "Highclere" - in Portofino
                            he learned sailing. 1887 he went on his first journey on his small sailing ship "Aphrodite"
                            with a Captain an a complete crew. Many places he visited were still unknown to the English
                            at that time. On these long journeys to the sea he discovered his desire for reading. So
                            Lord Carnarvon became a collector of rare (illuminated) books.<br />
                            1890 he travelled to South America, Australia and Japan. On his return to England he was
                            confronted with his father's death on June 28th of 1890. So he inherited the title Earl of
                            Carnarvon at the age of 23. Still he kept travelling and followed his passions for sports
                            and history. In 1894 he chartered the yacht "Catarina" and went on a second journey to
                            South America. </p>
                        <p>When he returned from his second journey to South America he married Almina Victoria Maria
                            Alexandra Wombell in Magarete's Church on his 29th birthday on June 26th of 1895. She is
                            the illegitimate daugher of Alfred Rothschild (1842-1918), a heir of the famous London
                            banker family. Her endowment was a sum of half a million pounds. She gave birth to the
                            wished inheritor Henry on November 7th of 1898 as well as to their daughter Evelyn on
                            August 15th 1901, who later became her fathers travel companien and care taker when he was
                            sick. The family used to spend the hunting season in Brenton Hall and the opera season in
                            London. He loved his children and was a good father to them. There were ever again
                            spontanoious journeys to Paris, Istanbul, Sweden, Italy and Berlin. After Alfred
                            Rothschild's death in 1918 Lady Carnarvon became the only inheritor<br />
                            The Lord was always interested in
