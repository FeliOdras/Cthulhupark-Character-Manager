                    <p>Born on June 26th of 1866 in Highclere Castle he is part of the anglo-welsh dynasty Herbert
                        and
                        can look back on ancients back to King Edward III. and King Henry VII. As the only heir of
                        his
                        father Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, he also wears the courtesy title Lord

                    <div class="collapse p-3" id="charDescDetails">
                        <p>Tought by home teachers he was already able at the age of ten to talk French to his mother
                            and his educators. Besides he knew German, Latin grammar and basics of the Greek language.
                            He visited the universities of Eton and Cambridge. There he started to collect french
                            prints and drawings.<br />
                            During holidays at the family mansion Altachiara - Italian for "Highclere" - in Portofino
                            he learned sailing. 1887 he went on his first journey on his small sailing ship "Aphrodite"
                            with a Captain an a complete crew. Many places he visited were still unknown to the English
                            at that time. On these long journeys to the sea he discovered his desire for reading. So
                            Lord Carnarvon became a collector of rare (illuminated) books.<br />
                            1890 he travelled to South America, Australia and Japan. On his return to England he was
                            confronted with his father's death on June 28th of 1890. So he inherited the title Earl of
                            Carnarvon at the age of 23. Still he kept travelling and followed his passions for sports
                            and history. In 1894 he chartered the yacht "Catarina" and went on a second journey to
                            South America. </p>
                        <p>When he returned from his second journey to South America he married Almina Victoria Maria
                            Alexandra Wombell in Magarete's Church on his 29th birthday on June 26th of 1895. She is
                            the illegitimate daugher of Alfred Rothschild (1842-1918), a heir of the famous London
                            banker family. Her endowment was a sum of half a million pounds. She gave birth to the
                            wished inheritor Henry on November 7th of 1898 as well as to their daughter Evelyn on
                            August 15th 1901, who later became her fathers travel companien and care taker when he was
                            sick. The family used to spend the hunting season in Brenton Hall and the opera season in
                            London. He loved his children and was a good father to them. There were ever again
                            spontanoious journeys to Paris, Istanbul, Sweden, Italy and Berlin. After Alfred
                            Rothschild's death in 1918 Lady Carnarvon became the only inheritor<br />
                            The Lord had always been interested in mechanical inventions, so it is not surprising that
                            that Captain Geoffrey de Havilland invented the first airplane on Herbert's property in
                            Beacon Hill that was later enhanced to the D.H.9 and became one of the main airplanes
                            during war. The third licensed car in the U.K. was his. He already owned a car in France,
                            where you could buy them earlier than in England. He liked to drive hisself and to drive
                            fast. He was seriously injured in an accident in Hessia, Germany in 1901. When on the crest
                            of a hill an oxcart crossed his path he evaded to the side and overturned. This was
                            followed by torturous headaches that made it impossible for him to continue with sport
                            shooting. He changed to golfing and turned towards photography, where he gained mastery
                            within a short period of time. 1916 he was voted for president of the Camera Club. <br />
                            Lord Carnarvon spends the winter months in Egypt. Here he found interest in archeology.
                            Since he did not have the needed expertise he was looking for an excavation director. The
                            director of egyptian antiquity administration in Cairo, Gaston Maspero, suggested Howard
                            Carter for this task. In the year of 1909 they started their cooperation.</p>
